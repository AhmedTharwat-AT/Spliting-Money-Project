# Spliting money project
----
### This is a `React js` practice project from jonas schmedtmann React course , i created the project components on my own including the logic but i dont own the idea or the styles as it was already written .
- This project helped me practice `State Mangement` and how components can send data between each other and how to conditionally render a component.
- I learned how it can get so tedious when lifting up or driling state to reach the targeted component , so the need to learn a powerful state mangement library like `Recoil or Redux` to centeralize
the state and make the project easier to understand amd to find bugs .
